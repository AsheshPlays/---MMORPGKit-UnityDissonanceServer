# unity-dissonance-server
A lite Dissonance server (https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance).
Planned to make a lightweight Dissonance server, use low-level of network-manager which has no gameplay features, it use `LiteNetLibManager` as a server and client.
I actually want to make a server outside Unity (May uses .NET6) but I have to learn Dissonance codes in depth first.

*Requirement*
- [Dissonance](https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance), it is not include in this repo, you have to buy it.
- [LiteNetLibManager](https://github.com/insthync/LiteNetLibManager)
- [LiteNetLibManager-Dissonance-Integration](https://github.com/insthync/LiteNetLibManager-Dissonance-Integration)
